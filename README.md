# UserApp
This is the UserApp application created in javafx, and scene builder
*
Did not have enough time to change database hoursWorked(int) to sales(double), and controllers/ views naming conventions from "hours" to "sales"
sales accepts an integer value, which should be double, and spinner was changed from non editable to editable so that drastic integer
changes can be made to sales.
